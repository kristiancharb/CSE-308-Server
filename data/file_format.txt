Precincts:
	- Divided into two files (_info.json and _geo.json)
	- Info contains voting and population info
	- Info is in dictionary format (key is precinct id)
	- Attributes (that aren't self explanatory):
    		'gov_dvote' : democratic votes for governor
    		'gov_rvote' : republican " "
    		'comp_dvote' : democratic votes for comptroller
    		'comp_rvote' : republican " "
   		'uss_dvote' : democratic votes for senator
    		'uss_rvote' : republican " "
	
	- Geo is an array of geojson features (in proper format)
	- Each feature consists of the geometry array and properties dict which contains the precinct geo_id

	Geo Format:
	{geoid : { type: Feature, geometry: {...}, properties: { geoid: ... } }, ... } 

	Info Format:
	{ geoid : {
		'voting_age_population' : ...
		'population': ....
		'district_id': ...
		'gov_dvote' : democratic votes for governor
    		'gov_rvote' : republican " "
    		'comp_dvote' : democratic votes for comptroller
    		'comp_rvote' : republican " "
   		'uss_dvote' : democratic votes for senator
    		'uss_rvote' : republican " " }
	}
		

Districts: 
	- Uses district number as ID in properties dict and as the key in the info dict

	Geo Format:
	{district_id : { type: Feature, geometry: {...}, properties: { district_id: ... } }, ... }

	Info Format:
	{ district_id : {
		'voting_age_population' : ...
		'population': ....
		'gov_dvote' : democratic votes for governor
    		'gov_rvote' : republican " "
    		'comp_dvote' : democratic votes for comptroller
    		'comp_rvote' : republican " "
   		'uss_dvote' : democratic votes for senator
    		'uss_rvote' : republican " " }
	}

States: 
	- Only one feature geojson and one info dict

	Geo Format:
	 { type: Feature, geometry: {...}, properties: { district_id: ... } }, ... ] 

	Info Format:
	{
		'voting_age_population' : ...
		'population': ....
		'gov_dvote' : democratic votes for governor
    		'gov_rvote' : republican " "
    		'comp_dvote' : democratic votes for comptroller
    		'comp_rvote' : republican " "
   		'uss_dvote' : democratic votes for senator
    		'uss_rvote' : republican " " }
